## Script - [Link](https://github.com/IvanaRagusa/cpp/tree/main/script)
2 simple scripts to create Superclass and hinerited class in canonical form
### usage: 
- launch script ``` phyton3 SuperclassGenerate.py ``` or ``` phyton3 InerithedGenerate.py ```
- insert required classes name
- the script will ganerate two files, a .cpp file and .hpp file! Enjoy it!
Tou can find the same script in italian Lenguage!

### tips:
To pass the exam successfully, stick to these 2 simple rules to get around the subjets that are not always crystal clear:
1. make every single string you encounter as ``` const string & ``` ;
2. make all possible methods as constants (except obviously those that modify the      structure such as setters for example), including the pure clone method which will look like this: ``` virtual <Classname> * clone() const = 0 ``` ;

I'm sure that with these two simple rules and a lot of ```ctrl F2``` you won't have any problems! Feel free to leave a star if these suggestions were useful to you!!
